<section>
  <p>I believe that <strong>words and data</strong> are the two most powerful tools to change the world.</p>

  <p>Most of my time is spent staring at a computer screen. During the day, I am usually programming, working to derive insight from large datasets. My skills include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Data analysis, visualization, and machine learning</li>
    <li>Web scraping and real-time data integration</li>
    <li>ETL pipeline development and data migration</li>
    <li>Problem-solving with a strong focus on end-to-end delivery</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I often work on end-to-end data science projects that start by collecting data from third-party sources and end with delivering business insights such as customer segmentation.</p>

  <p>I am a <strong>Data Engineering professional with 4+ years of experience</strong> building solutions for complex business problems involving large-scale data processing and real-time analytics. I have hands-on expertise in integrating state-of-the-art Big Data technologies into enterprise architecture.</p>
